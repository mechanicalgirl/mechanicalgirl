<!-- Currently working on ... and associated projects.  -->

I'm a Site Reliability Engineer with five years of experience building and maintaining multi-cloud infrastructure at scale. Before moving into SRE, I spent nearly two decades as an application developer. I specialize in automation, infrastructure as code, and making complex systems manageable - whether that's automating TLS certificate management for hundreds of domains, building cost-saving alerting systems, or migrating legacy deployments to modern Kubernetes workflows.

I have also been a speaker and educator in the Python community. From 2013-2018 I organized and taught the Young Coders tutorials at PyCon, teaching Python to middle school students. I've also been a conference speaker at DjangoCon and PyCon. My last appearance onstage was on the "Building on a connected ecosystem" panel at Fastly’s Xcelerate LA in 2025.
